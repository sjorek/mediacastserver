Mediacast Server
================

  Version 0.0.1

  This project provides a webserver for static content with support for
  virtual-hosts, path-aliases, per-host/-ip traffic-shaping capabilities,
  reverse-proxing with internal url-translation and multicast-DNS (bonjour)
  service-advertisement written in Python.

What is this?
=============

  The main purpose of this webserver is bandwidth-limiting.  Therefore it
  utilizes the token-bucket algorithm.  The server is ideal to be used in
  multimedia-production toolchains, in order to verify http-video- and audio-
  streaming bandwidth-usage and browser behavior in this context.  Currently
  it is used to serve content as produced by Apple's mediastreamsegmenter or
  the f4f-file format as specified by Adobe.

  The implementation is based upon the fantastic Twisted-Framework and is
  implemented as a plugin therein.

  As Twisted supports integration into the Win32, Mac OSX and of course Linux
  operating systems, the server should work in these environments.  Currently
  only Mac OSX 10.6.x are tested and used.  Apple's default python-installation
  and twisted-package is sufficient in order to run the webserver.  That also
  means that at this time only python 2.6 is verified.


Installing
==========

  Instructions for installing this software are in INSTALL.


Usage
=====

  Execute `PYTHONPATH=path/to/mediacastserver twistd mediacastserver --help` to
  get a detailed command usage reference.


Documentation and Support
=========================

  Sorry, but at this early stage you have to use the force and read the source.

  Help might also be available on the Twisted mailing list:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python

  If you need more inspiration than these sources provide, feel free to contact
  me.


TODOs / Roadmap
===============

  * Write a setup.py
  * Write unit-tests (a shame that it's not yet done, i know)
  * Get rid of the Apple-specific bonjour and hostname implementation, test and
    support Avahi-Daemon
  * Make mDNS-support optional anyway, as it creates an additional dependency
    to pybonjour-package
  * Test and support Win32-environments
