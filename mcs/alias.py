    Original implementation in twisted.web.rewrite.alias.  This one
    supports an empty alias destination.

    I am not a very good aliaser. But I'm the best I can be. If I'm
    aliasing to a Resource that generates links, and it uses any parts
    of request.prepath to do so, the links will not be relative to the
    aliased path, but rather to the aliased-to path. That I can't
    alias static.File directory listings that nicely. However, I can
    still be useful, as many resources will play nice.
